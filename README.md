# Updated Portfolio

For this project, I was able to do a dive back to the early weeks of the UCD coding program and update my Portfolio Page project. As one of our initial homework assignments, it was the first time in my life I had to generate code from scratch and deploy a live website. 

In completing this project, I now have a mobile-friendly landing page to be able to submit to potential employers, or colleagues and friends as a way to dempnstrate the skills I have acquired in my web dev career!

In building this page and designing it, I was able to see just how far my comprehension of web and mobile development has come since I started this program. I remember being very excited about my first portfolio page, even proud; I had made something from nothing, with a devent representation of my aesthetic, and it was LIVE onthe internet! Now, when I look back, I see how poorly it would display on mobile layouts, and so I was very pleased to see that my improved grasp of the code resulted in a much more fluid, mobile-friendly layout. 

At this point in our progress I have learned the value of Bootstrap, in it's ability to allow me to rapidly style and position elements in a page. I still prefer to put my own park on a page, and so I made sure to not leave this looking like it was completely templated.
